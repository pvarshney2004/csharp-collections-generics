## 📂 Branch Structure

### 🔹 `generics` branch
This branch focuses on **Generics in C#**, demonstrating how to write **type-safe, reusable, and scalable code** using generic classes, generic methods, constraints, interfaces, and variance. The problems are modeled around **real-world systems** to show how generics improve flexibility while maintaining compile-time safety.

### 📝 Practice Problems

### Smart Warehouse Management System  
**Concepts:** Generic Classes, Constraints, Variance  
- Manage different warehouse items such as Electronics, Groceries, and Furniture.  
- Use a generic `Storage<T>` class constrained to a base `WarehouseItem`.  
- Store and display items safely using `List<T>`.

### Dynamic Online Marketplace  
**Concepts:** Type Parameters, Generic Methods, Constraints  
- Build a generic product catalog supporting multiple product categories.  
- Apply discounts using generic methods while ensuring type safety.  
- Support diverse product types within a single catalog.

### Multi-Level University Course Management System  
**Concepts:** Generic Classes, Constraints, Variance  
- Manage different course evaluation types such as exam-based and assignment-based courses.  
- Use a generic `Course<T>` class constrained to a base `CourseType`.  
- Handle multiple course types dynamically using collections.

### Personalized Meal Plan Generator  
**Concepts:** Generic Methods, Constraints, Interfaces  
- Generate meal plans like Vegetarian, Vegan, Keto, and High-Protein.  
- Use interfaces with generic classes to enforce meal plan rules.  
- Dynamically validate and generate meal plans using generic methods.

---

### AI-Driven Resume Screening System  
**Concepts:** Generic Classes, Generic Methods, Constraints  
- Process resumes for different job roles such as Software Engineer and Data Scientist.  
- Use a generic `Resume<T>` class constrained to a base `JobRole`.  
- Screen and manage multiple resumes efficiently using generic collections.
